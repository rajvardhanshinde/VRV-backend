# VRV Project

The VRV Project is a web-based platform designed for task and user profile management. It provides a seamless experience by offering role-based access to users and administrators. The platform allows users to create, update, and view tasks, while admins can manage tasks and user profiles with full access. The application uses Spring Boot for the backend, Hibernate for ORM, MySQL as the database, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profile. Role-based access is implemented, with distinct roles for users and admins.
- **Task Management**: Users can create tasks with detailed information. Admins can manage tasks for all users.
- **Security**: Uses Spring Security, JWT for authentication, and BCrypt Password Encoder for secure password storage and access control.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels are provided to Users and Admins to manage resources based on roles.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL with Hibernate ORM
- **Security**: Spring Security, JWT, BCrypt Password Encoder
- **Frontend**: Minimalistic, intuitive design (supports interaction with RESTful APIs)
